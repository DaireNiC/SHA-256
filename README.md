# Secure Hash Algorithim 

This repo contains an implementation of the SHA 256 algorithim written in the C programming language.

The code was written in accordance to the the Secure Hash Algorthim as specified by the  US government in the following [doccument]([https://www.nist.gov/publications/secure-hash-standard](https://www.nist.gov/publications/secure-hash-standard)).


> The hash algorithms specified in this Standard are called secure because, for a given algorithm, it is computationally infeasible 1) to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or 2) to find two different messages that produce the same message digest. Any change to a message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest. This will result in a verification failure when the secure hash algorithm is used with a digital signature algorithm or a keyed-hash message authentication algorithm.

# SHA 256
The secure hashing algorithim can be described int two stages:

 1. Preprocessing the message
 2. Hash Computation
